# E-News-project
It's a project for A/B testing
Background:
An online news portal aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. Every visitor to the website takes certain actions based on their interest. The company plans to analyze these interests and wants to determine whether a new feature will be effective or not. Companies often analyze users' responses to two variants of a product to decide which of the two variants is more effective. This experimental technique is known as a/b testing that is used to determine whether a new feature attracts users based on a chosen metric.
The design team of the company has created a new landing page. You have been assigned the task to decide whether the new landing page is more effective to gather new subscribers. Suppose you randomly selected 100 users and divided them equally into two groups. The old landing page is served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page is served to the second group (treatment group). Various data about the customers in both groups are collected in 'abtest.csv'. Perform the statistical analysis to answer the following questions using the collected data.

Data Dictionary:
user_id - This represents the user ID of the person visiting the website.
group - This represents whether the user belongs to the first group (control) or the second group (treatment).
landing_page - This represents whether the landing page is new or old.
time_spent_on_the_page - This represents the time (in minutes) spent by the user on the landing page.
converted - This represents whether the user gets converted to a subscriber of the news portal or not.
language_preferred - This represents the language chosen by the user to view the landing page.
